# Holy Responsive Grid

Make it look like the pictures! (Plus the second article. Whoops... picture coming on that.)


### Tools

Don't forget that you can use the following tools:

* Media queries.
* Naming grid lines in your `grid-template-columns`/`grid-template-rows`
* And/or naming areas with `grid-template-areas`.


### Breakpoints

Feel free to use your own breakpoints, but our suggestion (for testability reasons):

* mobile: under 500px
* tablet: between 500px and 1100px
* desktop: over 1100px
